The Street Light SOS System is an intelligent safety and automation project designed to enhance public security using IoT and AI.
This system uses a Raspberry Pi integrated with face expression recognition to detect distress or unusual emotions on a person’s face and trigger automatic SOS alerts along with smart street light activation.

⚙️ Key Features

💡 Smart Street Lighting: Automatically turns ON/OFF based on presence and environmental light.

😨 Facial Expression Detection: Recognizes emotions such as fear, distress, or panic using deep learning models.

🚨 SOS Alert Mechanism: Sends alert signals when a distress expression is detected.

🌐 IoT Integration: Real-time monitoring and control through the Raspberry Pi.

🔋 Energy Efficient: Conserves power by activating lights only when necessary.
