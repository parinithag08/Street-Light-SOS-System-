## 📘 Overview  
The **Street Light SOS System** is an intelligent safety and automation project designed to enhance public security using **IoT and AI**.  
This system uses a **Raspberry Pi** integrated with face expression recognition to detect distress or unusual emotions on a person’s face and trigger **automatic SOS alerts** along with smart street light activation.  

## 🌟 Key Features  
- 💡 **Smart Street Lighting:** Automatically turns ON/OFF based on presence and environmental light.  
- 😨 **Facial Expression Detection:** Recognizes emotions such as fear, distress, or panic using deep learning models.  
- 🚨 **SOS Alert Mechanism:** Sends alert signals when a distress expression is detected.  
- 🌐 **IoT Integration:** Real-time monitoring and control through the Raspberry Pi.  
- 🔋 **Energy Efficient:** Conserves power by activating lights only when necessary.  

## 🧠 Technologies Used  
**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, PIR Sensor, LEDs, Buzzer  
**Programming Languages:** Python, OpenCV  
**Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy 
**Concepts:** Image Processing, Facial Emotion Recognition, IoT Automation  

## 🧩 System Architecture  
1. Camera captures live video feed from the environment.  
2. Emotion recognition model analyzes facial expressions.  
3. If distress (e.g., fear, panic) is detected → SOS alert triggered.  
4. Street light automatically activates, buzzer sounds, and optional message alert is sent.  

## 🧾 Output & Results  
- Real-time emotion detection displayed on the screen.  
- Immediate activation of lights and buzzer on distress detection.  
- Improved safety and optimized energy usage.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Integration with **cloud services** for remote monitoring.  
- Adding **GPS-based location tracking** for emergency alerts.  
- Expanding the emotion dataset for higher accuracy.
